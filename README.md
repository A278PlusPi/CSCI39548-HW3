# Grid App
Combining the elixir of efforts in our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, we have made our Grid website. The current functionality of the Grid website is adding and removing columns or rows, filling all cells or uncolored cells, putting the color for one cell, clearing the grid, and getting the dimensions of the grid.
